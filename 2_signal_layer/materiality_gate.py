"""
materiality_gate.py
The single entry point for Phase 2. Decides whether a KPI movement is
"material" — statistically real AND business-significant enough to
proceed to investigation. Combines control_limits, seasonal_decompose,
and sparse_history_fallback, reading thresholds from kpi_contract.yaml
so nothing is duplicated or hardcoded here.

Supports evaluating a specific historical week (target_date) as well
as the latest available week — needed since our scenario anchors are
specific past weeks, not necessarily the most recent one in the dataset.
